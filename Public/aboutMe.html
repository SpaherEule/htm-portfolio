    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a grade 12 student that is about to finish his Abitur. I am also busy enrolling in a Wb development course
        that has made me code this Web page as a way to test my skills. so ja. still looks bad but I am working on it. I
        am also very interested in robotics and engineering. as such I am planning to go study electronical engineering
        at UP.
